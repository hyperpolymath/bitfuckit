== What is bitfuckit?

`bitfuckit` is a command-line interface for Bitbucket Cloud, written in Ada/SPARK for reliability and formal verification.

=== Why Does This Exist?

Every major git forge has an official CLI:

* **GitHub** → `gh`
* **GitLab** → `glab`
* **Codeberg** → `tea`
* **SourceHut** → `hut`
* **Gitea** → `tea`

**Bitbucket has nothing.** Atlassian, a company valued at over $50 billion, has not provided CLI tooling for their flagship version control product.

This tool fills that gap.

=== Key Features

* **Authentication** — App password-based authentication
* **Repository CRUD** — Create, list, delete, check existence
* **Pull Requests** — List PRs with state filtering
* **Mirroring** — One-command GitHub-to-Bitbucket mirroring
* **Interactive TUI** — Vim-style navigation with color interface
* **GraphQL API** — Programmatic access for automation
* **SPARK Verification** — Formally verified TUI specification

== Installation

=== Quick Install (Linux)

----
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/hyperpolymath/bitfuckit.git
