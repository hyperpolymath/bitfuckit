== General

=== Why is it called "bitfuckit"?

The name reflects the frustration of needing to build a tool that should already exist. Atlassian has had over a decade to provide a Bitbucket CLI and hasn't. At some point, you just say "bit-fuck-it" and build it yourself.

=== Is this an official Atlassian product?

**No.** This is an unofficial, community-built tool. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Atlassian Pty Ltd.

See the link:../README.adoc#disclaimer[Disclaimer] for full legal notice.

=== Why Ada? Why not Python/Go/Rust?

Several reasons:

. **Reliability** — Ada's strong typing catches errors at compile time
. **SPARK** — Formal verification proves correctness of critical code
. **Differentiator** — Every other CLI tool is in Go or Rust
. **Learning** — The author wanted to use Ada for a real project
. **Statement** — To show that "boring" languages produce working software

=== Is the TUI really formally verified?

The TUI **specification** (`tui.ads`) uses SPARK Mode, which allows formal verification of the interface contract. The implementation has SPARK annotations for key invariants.

This doesn't mean the entire TUI is bug-free, but it demonstrates that formal methods can be applied to CLI tools.

== Installation

=== Why do I need GNAT to build?

GNAT is the Ada compiler. It's available in most Linux distributions:

* Fedora: `sudo dnf install gcc-gnat gprbuild`
* Ubuntu: `sudo apt install gnat gprbuild`
* Arch: `yay -S gcc-ada`

=== Can I use it on macOS?

Yes, but it's untested. You'll need:

* GNAT from Homebrew: `brew install gprbuild`
* Or AdaCore's GNAT Community Edition

=== What about Windows?

Windows support is planned for v1.0. You'd need GNAT for Windows from AdaCore.

== Authentication

=== What's an app password?

An app password is a Bitbucket-specific authentication token. It's different from your account password and can have limited permissions.

Create one at: https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/

=== Is my password stored securely?

Currently, credentials are stored in **plain text** in `~/.config/bitfuckit/config`. This is a known security issue (SEC-002) that will be addressed with system keyring integration.

In the meantime:

* Set appropriate file permissions: `chmod 600 ~/.config/bitfuckit/config`
* Use an app password with minimal permissions
* Revoke and regenerate if compromised

=== Can I use SSH instead?

Not currently. The tool uses the REST API which requires HTTP authentication. SSH is used for git operations (push/pull) but not API calls.

== Features

=== Can I create pull requests?

Not yet. PR creation is planned for v0.2.0. Currently you can only list PRs.

=== Does it support Bitbucket Server/Data Center?

No. Only Bitbucket Cloud (bitbucket.org) is supported. Server/Data Center have different APIs.

=== Can I use it for CI/CD?

Yes! The CLI and GraphQL API work well in automated environments:

[source,bash]
----
# In CI script
export BITFUCKIT_WORKSPACE=myworkspace
bitfuckit repo exists my-repo || bitfuckit repo create my-repo
bitfuckit mirror my-repo
----

== Troubleshooting

=== "curl: command not found"

Install curl:

* Fedora: `sudo dnf install curl`
* Ubuntu: `sudo apt install curl`
* macOS: Usually pre-installed

=== "gprbuild: command not found"

You need to install the Ada build tools:

* Fedora: `sudo dnf install gprbuild`
* Ubuntu: `sudo apt install gprbuild`

=== "Authentication failed"

. Verify your **username** (not email address)
. Regenerate your app password
. Ensure app password has required permissions
. Check workspace slug is correct

=== "Repository not found"

. Repository names are case-sensitive
. Verify you have access to the repository
. Check the workspace is correct

=== The TUI looks broken

. Ensure your terminal supports ANSI colors
. Try: `export TERM=xterm-256color`
. If using SSH, ensure your connection supports colors

== Development

=== How do I contribute?

See link:Contributing[Contributing Guide].

Priority areas:

. PR workflows (create/merge/decline)
. Input validation/sanitization
. Additional test coverage
. Documentation improvements

=== Why AGPL instead of MIT/Apache?

The AGPL ensures that if Atlassian (or any company) uses this code in their products, they must contribute improvements back to the community.

Given that this tool exists because Atlassian hasn't provided one, it's only fair that they can't take without giving back.

=== Can I use this code in my proprietary product?

If you're building a proprietary product, you'd need to:

. Open-source your modifications under AGPL
. Or contact the author about licensing
