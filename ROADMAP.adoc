== Technical Debt & Improvements

=== Security Hardening (Priority: High)

* [ ] Migrate from process-spawned curl to native HTTP client
* [ ] Secure credential storage (libsecret/keyring integration)
* [ ] Input sanitization for all API parameters
* [ ] Remove credentials from process command lines

=== Code Quality

* [ ] Expand SPARK coverage beyond TUI
* [ ] Add AUnit test framework
* [ ] Implement structured logging
* [ ] Add telemetry opt-in for crash reporting

=== Performance

* [ ] Connection pooling for API requests
* [ ] Response caching for list operations
* [ ] Lazy loading in TUI for large datasets

== Contributing

See link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc[CONTRIBUTING.adoc] for contribution guidelines.

Priority areas for contributions:

1. Pull request workflows (v0.2.0 features)
2. Windows platform testing
3. Additional package formats
4. SPARK proof expansion

== Non-Goals

These features are explicitly out of scope:

* Bitbucket Server/Data Center support (Cloud only)
* Admin/workspace settings management
* Jira integration configuration
* Billing/subscription management
* Features requiring OAuth2 web flows
* GUI applications

If Atlassian wants these features in a CLI, they can build one themselves.
