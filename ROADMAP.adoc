= bitfuckit Roadmap
:toc:
:toclevels: 3

This document outlines the development roadmap for bitfuckit, the community-built Bitbucket CLI.

== Philosophy

We build what Atlassian won't. Every feature prioritized here represents functionality that should exist in an official tool but doesn't.

== Current Status: v0.5.0

All v0.5.0 modules complete. Now focusing on GraphQL server completion and container packaging.

== What's in v0.2.0 (Current Release)

== Integration Points

=== Required for v0.5.0
* cicada - Quantum-resistant credential storage
* syncthing - Distributed sync
* CubsDB - Robust storage
* OpenTimestamp - Blockchain provenance
* ClamAV/VirusTotal - Security scanning

=== Optional Enhancements
* rhodibot - RSR compliance automation
* complete-linux-internet-repair - Network self-healing
* hunspell - Spell checking
* translate-shell - Translation
* agrep - Fuzzy search
* pssh - Parallel operations
* aria2 - Download acceleration

== Technical Debt for v1.0.0

=== Security (Critical)
* [ ] Replace curl subprocess with native HTTP
* [ ] Integrate with system keyring (libsecret)
* [ ] Remove credentials from process argv
* [ ] Add SBOM generation

=== Code Quality (High)
* [ ] Expand SPARK proofs to all modules
* [ ] AUnit test framework integration
* [ ] Structured logging (JSON)
* [ ] Crash telemetry (opt-in)

=== Performance (Medium)
* [ ] Connection pooling
* [ ] Response caching
* [ ] Lazy loading in TUI

== Contributing

See link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc[CONTRIBUTING.adoc].

Priority areas:
1. GraphQL server completion
2. Windows testing
3. Package formats (Homebrew, Nix)
4. SPARK expansion
5. OAuth2 implementation

== Non-Goals

Out of scope:
* Bitbucket Server/Data Center (Cloud only)
* Admin workspace settings
* Jira integration config
* Billing management
* GUI applications

If Atlassian wants these, they can build their own CLI.
