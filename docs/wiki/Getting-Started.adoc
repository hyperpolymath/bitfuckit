This guide will get you up and running with bitfuckit in 5 minutes.

== Prerequisites

Before installing bitfuckit, ensure you have:

* A Bitbucket Cloud account
* An https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/[app password] with appropriate permissions
* `curl` installed (usually pre-installed on Linux/macOS)

== Installation

=== Option 1: Build from Source (Recommended)

[source,bash]
----
# Install build dependencies (Fedora)
sudo dnf install gcc-gnat gprbuild

# Install build dependencies (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install gnat gprbuild

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/hyperpolymath/bitfuckit.git
cd bitfuckit
just build install
----

=== Option 2: AUR (Arch Linux)

[source,bash]
----
yay -S bitfuckit
----

=== Option 3: Download Binary

Download the latest release from https://github.com/hyperpolymath/bitfuckit/releases[GitHub Releases].

== First-Time Setup

=== Step 1: Create an App Password

. Go to https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/[Bitbucket App Passwords]
. Click **Create app password**
. Name it something like "bitfuckit CLI"
. Select permissions:
** ✓ `repository:read`
** ✓ `repository:write`
** ✓ `repository:delete` (if you want to delete repos)
** ✓ `pullrequest:read`
. Click **Create**
. **Copy the password immediately** — you won't see it again!

=== Step 2: Authenticate

[source,bash]
----
bitfuckit auth login
----

You'll be prompted for:

* **Username**: Your Bitbucket username (not email)
* **App Password**: The password you just created
* **Workspace**: Your default workspace (usually your username)

=== Step 3: Verify Authentication

[source,bash]
----
bitfuckit auth status
----

Expected output:
[source]
----
✓ Authenticated as: yourusername
  Workspace: yourusername
----

== Your First Commands

=== List Repositories

[source,bash]
----
bitfuckit repo list
----

=== Create a Repository

[source,bash]
----
# Public repository
bitfuckit repo create my-project

# Private repository
bitfuckit repo create my-private-project --private

# With description
bitfuckit repo create my-project --description "My awesome project"
----

=== Check Repository Existence

[source,bash]
----
bitfuckit repo exists my-project
# Output: ✓ Repository 'my-project' exists
----

=== List Pull Requests

[source,bash]
----
# List open PRs
bitfuckit pr list my-project

# List merged PRs
bitfuckit pr list my-project --state MERGED

# List all PRs
bitfuckit pr list my-project --all
----

== Using the TUI

Launch the interactive terminal interface:

[source,bash]
----
bitfuckit tui
# or just

== Mirroring from GitHub

If you have a GitHub repository you want to mirror to Bitbucket:

[source,bash]
----
# Navigate to your GitHub repo
cd ~/my-github-repo

# Mirror to Bitbucket (creates repo if needed)
bitfuckit mirror my-repo
----

This will:

. Create the repository on Bitbucket if it doesn't exist
. Push all branches to Bitbucket
. Push all tags to Bitbucket

== Next Steps

* link:Authentication[Authentication] — Advanced auth configuration
* link:Repository-Operations[Repository Operations] — Full repo management
* link:CLI-Reference[CLI Reference] — Complete command reference
* link:TUI-Guide[TUI Guide] — Master the interactive interface

== Common Issues

=== "Authentication failed"

* Verify your username (not email)
* Regenerate your app password
* Check that the password has required permissions

=== "Workspace not found"

* Use your actual workspace slug, not display name
* Check at https://bitbucket.org/account/workspaces/

=== "Repository not found"

* Ensure you have access to the repository
* Check that the repository name is correct (case-sensitive)
